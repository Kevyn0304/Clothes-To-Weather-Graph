# Clothes-To-Weather-Graph
Program a graph that will take inputs regarding the current day's projected weather and predict what outfit will be most comfortable for the day. 
Will start off with user input and graph as the days go by until predictions become consistent and accurate.

## Variables/Factors
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Air Quality
* Wind Velocity (because there's direction)

## Prediction Method
* Line of Best Fit
* Machine Learning?

## Outfit Options
* Sweater
* Long Sleeve
* Short Sleeve
* Shorts
* Pants
* Undershirt

Will start with user input every afternoon, stating what outfits were used.
The weather information will be automatically retrieved from the internet (some weather API).

### Future Ideas
* Graph will be displayed on Smart Mirror (if i ever build it)
* and/or make a basic android app and replace current weather widget with my own widget
