# Weather-to-Clothes Project
Program a graph that will take inputs regarding the current day's projected weather and predict what outfit will be most comfortable for the day. 
Will start off with user input and graph as the days go by until predictions become consistent and accurate.

## Variables/Factors
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Air Quality

## Prediction Method
* Line of Best Fit
* Machine Learning?

## Outfit Options
* Shorts
* Pants/Short sleeve
* Pants/Long sleeve
* Sweater

Will start with user input every afternoon, stating what outfits were used.
The weather information will be automatically retrieved from the internet (some weather API).

### Future Ideas
* Graph will be displayed on Smart Mirror (if i ever build it)
* and/or make a basic android app and replace current weather widget with my own widget
* V1, completley passive, no interaction with UI, only displays stuff that's hardcoded/preset
* V2, add Google AIY Voice Kit and display stuff based on voice commands/interact with Google Home


Sergio Peterson will hopefully help because he knows how to do data stuff.
I will be in charge of managing since this is my project.

hopefully this will be the project i finally finish
Hosted on desktop or terminal if done before smart mirror
